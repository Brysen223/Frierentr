# Frieren: Spell-Grimoire

A browser-based action RPG prototype built around two connected styles of play:

- **Overworld:** top-down exploration, quests, travel, and spell-based problem solving.
- **Dungeons:** side-view platforming, combat, secrets, bosses, and grimoire rewards.

Both modes share one character, one progression state, and one story.

## Quick start

For the easy path, double-click the launcher matching the workspace you want:

- `Launch - Main.bat`
- `Launch - Brysen.bat`
- `Launch - Dakota.bat`

Each personal launcher uses its own folder, branch, and port. It never switches another workspace's branch or modifies uncommitted files.

To start the main workspace manually:

```powershell
.\scripts\start.ps1
```

Then open [http://127.0.0.1:49217](http://127.0.0.1:49217).

Python 3 is the only local requirement. On Windows, `scripts\start.bat` is also available.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `WASD` / arrow keys | Move |
| `Space` | Dodge in the overworld; jump in dungeons |
| Hold `Space` in air | Use Flugmagie after unlocking it |
| `J` | Cast or attack |
| `E` | Interact |
| `R` | Rest at a campfire |

Read [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) before moving code across these boundaries.

## Branches

- `main` is the stable integration branch.
- `brysen` is Brysen's working branch.
- `dakota` is Dakota's working branch.

Make focused commits on the appropriate personal branch. Merge into `main` only after the game starts, the browser console is clean, and both gameplay modes still load.

## Current game loop

1. Explore Heiterfeld and help Heine with cursed bramble.
2. Upgrade Zoltraak and defeat the shade at Mondbrunnen.
3. Enter Hohlgrund and switch to side-view dungeon movement.
4. Search layered dungeons for passages, loot, bosses, and grimoires.
5. Carry the resulting progression back into the overworld.

## Status

This is a playable prototype, not a finished release. The immediate architectural goal is to make parallel work safe while the shared runtime is gradually divided into smaller systems.
